1) File Sharing Application is made to share file from one device to another without any other hardware requirements and only uses socket programming to share files. I have incorporated Merkle Tree to Share files and Encryption and Decryption is done using Fernet(Cryptography tool).
   Steps to Run it:
   1) Connect to the same network.
   2) Obtain the IP address of the host device on the network.
   3) Use that IP address on both devices.
   4) Share files located in the same working directory as the server or client.
